            More Than Just A Chocolate
        </h1>
        <p>Hershey’s Chocolate Company was founded in 1894 by Milton S. Hershey and his
            brother, William Kidd Hershey. The company began as an ice cream stand on Market Street
            in Philadelphia. In 1900, they opened their first factory to produce chocolate. Today,
            Hershey’s operates more than 70 manufacturing facilities worldwide and employs over
            6,000 people.</p>
